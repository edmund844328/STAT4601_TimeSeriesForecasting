# Features
- [x] Draw the time plot, and check whether or not it is stationary and whether or not it needs transformations
- [x] Transfer this time series into a stationary sequence if possible
- [x] Specify the model(s) based respectively on sample ACFs, and on the sample PACFs
- [x] Estimate the parameters by the maximum likelihood estimation method or others
- [x] Ljung-Box test to check the fitted model is adequate or not (Try serval Ks)
- [ ] Overparameterized method to check the adequacy of the fitted model
- [ ] Suggestion some alternative models if the fitted model is not adequate
- [ ] Check these alternative models.
- [ ] Use AIC to select one model if there are more than one adequate models
- [ ] Forecast the 5 future values, and compare them with the true values
- [ ] New insight into this time series based on the above process
